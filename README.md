How to use the app:
1. Open up server file on an IDE like Visual Studio Code
2. Run 'python db_script.py' to generate the database
3. Run 'python server.py' to start up the server
4. Open up the client side with Android Studio, download the app onto your Emulator, and you are good to go!

Note: For emulators, I recommend using the Pixel 6 Pro API 33

Best :)
